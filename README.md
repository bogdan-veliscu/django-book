# AWS Bucket setup

Here’s how you can create and configure an S3 bucket named `brandfocus` in the `eu-west-1` region using the AWS CLI:

### Step 1: Create the S3 Bucket

Run the following command to create the S3 bucket named `brandfocus` in the `eu-west-1` region:

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket brandfocus --region eu-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1
```

### Step 2: Configure Bucket Public Access (Optional)

If you want your S3 bucket to be publicly accessible, update the bucket's public access settings with this command:

```bash
aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket brandfocus --public-access-block-configuration BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false
```

### Step 3: Set Up Bucket Policy for Public Access (Optional)

If you want to allow public read access to the files in the `brandfocus` bucket, create a file called `bucket-policy.json` with the following content:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket brandfocus-ai --profile codeswiftr --policy \
'{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::brandfocus-ai/*"
        }
    ]
}'
```

### Step 4: Upload Files to Your S3 Bucket

To upload files to your `brandfocus` bucket, use the following commands:

To upload a single file:

```bash
aws s3 cp /path/to/your/file s3://brandfocus/
```

To sync an entire directory:

```bash
aws s3 sync /path/to/your/directory s3://brandfocus/
```

With these steps, you’ve created and configured the `brandfocus` S3 bucket in the `eu-west-1` region using the AWS CLI. This bucket is now ready for use in your Django application for storing static and media files.
